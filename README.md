Description language for usability patterns for geospatial applications

## Project Idea
In this repository, you will find various software artifacts which might be helpful to develop a description language for usability patterns for geospatial applications. Note that this is work in progress! 

## Functionality
Currently, these artifacts are available:  
- Adapted PLML ("pattern language markup language") schema definition
- Parser for a simple pattern description language for geospatial applications (wirking title: "EUPDL")
